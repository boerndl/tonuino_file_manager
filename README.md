# Tonuino File Manager
This is a tool to manage files and transfer files to a <a href=https://www.voss.earth/tonuino/>TonUino</a>.

Currently it can:

* Transfer files from a selected source directory to the TonUino SD card and renames the files to comply with the neccessary naming convention (i.e. 01/001.mp3, 01/002.mp3, 02/001.mp3, ...).
* Stores the names of the transfered folder in a database on the TonUino SD card.
* Shows ID3 titles of the tracks in the folders.

In the future it might be able to:

* Delete files on the SD card and it will put new files in the empty directory first rahter than creating a new directory.
* Add single files to a selected folder.
* Read in already existing folders that have been created outside of this app - currently, this will lead to trouble
